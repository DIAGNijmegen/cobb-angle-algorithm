# cobb-angle-algorithm

The Cobb angle algorithm code will be uploaded before 22-12-2023

## Requirements
Make sure you have the required dependencies installed. This includes the TIGER library. To install the latest version, open a command prompt an run: pip install git+https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/Tiger.git@stable

## Segmentations
Segmentation masks, used by this algorithm, are generated using U-Net based convolutional neural network.[1] The codebase for this algorithm can be found here: https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/SPIDER-Baseline-IIS. The algorithm is also publically available on the Grand Challenge platform: https://grand-challenge.org/algorithms/spider-baseline-iis/
